@article{Cummings:2008aa,
	abstract = {We introduce a statistic, the genealogical sorting index (gsi), for quantifying the degree of exclusive ancestry of labeled groups on a rooted genealogy and demonstrate its application. The statistic is simple, intuitive, and easily calculated. It has a normalized range to facilitate comparisons among different groups, trees, or studies and it provides information on individual groups rather than a composite measure for all groups. It naturally handles polytomies and accommodates measures of uncertainty in phylogenetic relationships. We use coalescent simulations to explore the behavior of the gsi across a range of divergence times, with the mean value increasing to 1, the maximum value when exclusivity within a group reached monophyly. Simulations also demonstrate that the power to reject the null hypothesis of mixed genealogical ancestry increased markedly as sample size increased, and that the gsi provides a statistically more powerful measure of divergence than FST. Applications to data from published studies demonstrated that the gsi provides a useful way to detect significant exclusivity even when groups are not monophyletic. Although we describe this statistic in the context of divergence, it is more broadly applicable to quantify and assess the significance of clustering of observations in labeled groups on any tree.},

@article{Yun:2022tn,
	abstract = {Micropollutants (MPs) released into aquatic ecosystems have adverse effects on public health. Hence, monitoring and managing MPs in aquatic systems are imperative. MPs can be quantified by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) with stable isotope-labeled (SIL) standards. However, high cost of SIL solutions is a significant issue. This study aims to develop a rapid and cost-effective analytical approach to estimate MP concentrations in aquatic systems based on deep learning (DL) and multi-objective optimization. We hypothesized that internal standards could quantify the MP concentrations other than the target substance. Our approach considered the precision of intra-/inter-day repeatability and natural organic matter information to reduce instrumental error and matrix effect. We selected standard solutions to estimate the concentrations of 18 MPs. Among the optimal DL models, DarkNet-53 using nine standard solutions yielded the highest performance, while ResNet-50 yielded the lowest. Overall, this study demonstrated the capability of DL models for estimating MP concentrations.},
